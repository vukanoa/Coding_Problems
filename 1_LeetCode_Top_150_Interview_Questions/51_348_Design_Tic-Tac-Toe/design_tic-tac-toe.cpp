	348) Design Tic-Tac-Toe
	===========================

	============
	Description:
	============

	Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a  n  x  n  grid.

	You may assume the following rules:

		1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
		2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
		3. A player who succeeds in placing  n  of their marks in a horizontal,
		   vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.


	Follow up:
	Could you do better than O(n^2) per move()

	Hint:
	Could you trade extra space such that move() operation can be done in O(1)?
	You need two arrays: int rows[n], int cols[n], plus two variables: diagonal,
	anti_diagonal. 


	=================================================
	FUNCTION: class TicTacToe{
	public:
		TicTacToe(){}

		int move(int row, int col, int player);
	private:
		std::vector<std::vector<int> board;
	}

	================================ EXAMPLES ================================
	==========================================================================

	--- Example 1 ---
	Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

	TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

	toe.move(0, 0, 1); - > Returns 0 (no one wins)
	| X |   |   |
	+---+---+---+
	|   |   |   |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
	+---+---+---+
	|   |   |   |


	toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
	| X |   | O |
	+---+---+---+
	|   |   |   |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
	+---+---+---+
	|   |   |   |


	toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
	| X |   | O |
	+---+---+---+
	|   |   |   |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2)
	+---+---+---+
	|   |   | X |


	toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
	| X |   | O |
	+---+---+---+
	|   | O |   |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1)
	+---+---+---+
	|   |   | X |


	toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
	| X |   | O |
	+---+---+---+
	|   | O |   |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0)
	+---+---+---+
	| X |   | X |


	toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
	| X |   | O |
	+---+---+---+
	| O | O |   |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0)
	+---+---+---+
	| X |   | X |


	toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
	| X |   | O |
	+---+---+---+
	| O | O |   |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1)
	+---+---+---+
	| X | X | X |
