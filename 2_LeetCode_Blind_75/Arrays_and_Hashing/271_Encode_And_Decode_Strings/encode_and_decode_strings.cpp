	============================
	659) Encode & Decode Strings
	============================

	============
	Description:
	============

	Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded
	string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original
	list of strings.

	Please implement "encode" and "decode".

	===============================
	CLASS: 
	class Codec {
	public:
		string encode(vector<string>& strs)
		{

		}

		vector<string> decode(string s)
		{

		}
	};
	===============================

	==========================================================================
	================================ EXAMPLES ================================
	==========================================================================

	--- Example 1 ---
	Input:  ["lint", "code", "love", "you"]
	Output: ["lint", "code", "love", "you"]
	Explanation:
	One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"

	*** Constraints ***
	Any ASCII character can be found in string!  // (Difficulty lies there)

	------------
	--- IDEA ---
	------------

	The tricky part is going to be that the basic assumption is that in our
	input we could have any possible ASCII character in the input. Not just
	limited to lowercase english letters!

	The difficult thing is going to be - How do we create some kind of
	delimiter between each word? How do we know when one word ends and the next
	one begins?

	Let's consider an example. Suppose we're given this example:

	    Input: ["leet", "code"]

	And we want to convert it to a single string. The naive way would be
	something like this:
	    "leetcode"
	
	Now the problem is - how do we decode this back into the original vector
	of strings, i.e. ["leet", "code"]?
	
	There is no way for us to determine where one string ends and where the
	other one begins.

	So, we can clearly see that we need some kind of delimiter or something to
	separate words.

	What if we used a '#' sign to separate words in our encoded string?
	We'd have:
	    "leet#code"
	
	In this case it works out. We processing character by character in the
	input and once we get to the '#' sign, we'll say that that the current
	words ends and we'll store it in decode_str vector of strings.

	So at the end our decode_str would look like:
	    ["leet", "code"]
	
	That works out in this case, but the assumption we're using here is that
	our delimiter, a '#' sign, is never going to actually show up in any words.

	What happens if we have this Input:
	    ["leet", "co#de"]
	
	In that case, if we do the same thing for encoding, we'd get an encoded_str
	that looks like this:
	    "leet#co#de"
	
	Now if we try to decode this, we'd get:
	    ["leet", "co", "de"]
	
	which isn't correct.

	
	So wouldn't it be nice if in the encoded string we somehow already knew
	how many characters already go in the first word, how many characters go
	in the second word, etc.

	If we had an additional array or vector, which would have corresponding
	lengths of the words, respectively:
	    [4, 5]
	
	But where are we going to store these? In the description of a problem,
	they don't want us to store any kind of "state variable". This "encode" and
	"decode" must be stateless.

	So, we cannot store it in a separate array or vector.
	Is it possible to store it in the encoded string itself?

	Using our 2nd Example:
	    ["leet", "co#de"]
	
	Intuitively something like this comes to mind:
	    "4leet5co#de"
	
	However this won't work if we had an Input with digits within words:
		["2leet", "12co#de"]
	
	Since our encoded string would look like:
	    "52leet712co#de"
	
	We wouldn't be able to tell how many digits in the front are only the
	indicators of the length of the word, and how many digits are the part of
	the word itself.

	Therefore, we need another delimiter.

	The encoded string, before each of the words, is going to start with a
	digit or multiple digits(if the word has 10 or more characters in it)
	followed by a delimiter of our choice. Let's say that, again, it's the '#'
	sign.

	Input: ["2leet", "14co#de"]

	Would be encoded like this:
	    "4#leet7#14co#de"
	
	It may seem suspicious. It may seem as if we're going to have a similar
	problem because we're using a '#' sign while that sign itself can be a part
	of the word.

	However, if you look closely, you'll see that it's impossible to confuse
	the delimiter from the character of the word itself.

	How?
	Well, we'll always start by collecting the digits up until the point when
	we stumble upon a first '#' sign. At that point we'll want to take the
	next <number> character EXCLUDING the '#' we stumbled upon. We're just
	going to ignore that '#' sign and take <number> characters and put it in
	our decode_str vector.

	We'll repeat the process for all the remaining characters.
