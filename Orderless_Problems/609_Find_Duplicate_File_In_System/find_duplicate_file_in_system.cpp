    ==================================
    609) Find Duplicate File in System
    ==================================

    ============
    Description:
    ============


    Given a list paths of directory info, including the directory path, and all
    the files with contents in this directory, return all the duplicate files
    in the file system in terms of their paths. You may return the answer in
    any order.

    A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have the
    same content.

    A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:

        "root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"

    It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt) with content
    (f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content) respectively in the directory
    "root/d1/d2/.../dm". Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the
    directory is just the root directory.

    The output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it
    contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file
    path is a string that has the following format:

        "directory_path/file_name.txt"

        + Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files?
          DFS or BFS?

        + If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify
          your solution?

        + If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify
          your solution?

        + What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the
          most time-consuming part and memory-consuming part of it? How to
          optimize?

        + How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false
          positive?

    ==========================================================================

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: paths = ["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)","root 4.txt(efgh)"]
    Output: [["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]

    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: paths = ["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)"]
    Output: [["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]

    *** Constraints ***
    1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4
    1 <= paths[i].length <= 3000
    1 <= sum(paths[i].length) <= 5 * 10^5
    paths[i] consist of English letters, digits, '/', '.', '(', ')', and ' '.
    You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.
    You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. A
    single blank space separates the directory path and file info.
