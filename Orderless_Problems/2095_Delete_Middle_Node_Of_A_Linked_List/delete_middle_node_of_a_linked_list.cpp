    2095) Delete a Middle Node of a Linked List
    ===========================================

    ============
    Description:
    ============

    You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return
    the head of the modified linked list.

    The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the
    start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less
    than or equal to x.

        For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2,
                                   respectively.

    FUNCTION: ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head);

    ================================ EXAMPLES ================================
    ==========================================================================

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
    Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
    Explanation:
    The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes
    are written below.  Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node,
    which is marked in red.  We return the new list after removing this node.


    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,2,4]
    Explanation:
    The above figure represents the given linked list.
    For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.


    --- Example 3 ---
    Input: head = [2,1]
    Output: [2]
    Explanation:
    The above figure represents the given linked list.
    For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
    Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.


    *** Constraints ***
    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10^5].
    1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
