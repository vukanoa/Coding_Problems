    ===================================================
    3317) Find the Number of Possible Ways for an Event
    ===================================================

    ============
    Description:
    ============


    You are given three integers n, x, and y.

    An event is being held for n performers. When a performer arrives, they are
    assigned to one of the x stages. All performers assigned to the same stage
    will perform together as a band, though some stages might remain empty.

    After all performances are completed, the jury will award each band a score
    in the range [1, y].

    Return the total number of possible ways the event can take place.

    Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

    Note that two events are considered to have been held differently if either
    of the following conditions is satisfied:

        Any performer is assigned a different stage.
        Any band is awarded a different score.

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: n = 1, x = 2, y = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation:
        There are 2 ways to assign a stage to the performer.
        The jury can award a score of either 1, 2, or 3 to the only band.

    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: n = 5, x = 2, y = 1
    Output: 32
    Explanation:
        Each performer will be assigned either stage 1 or stage 2.
        All bands will be awarded a score of 1.

    --- Example 3 ---
    Input: n = 3, x = 3, y = 4
    Output: 684


    *** Constraints ***
    1 <= n, x, y <= 1000
