    ===============================
    1732) Find The Highest Altitude
    ===============================

    ============
    Description:
    ============

    There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1
    points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with
    altitude equal 0.

    You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net
    gain in altitude between points i and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return
    the highest altitude of a point.

    =================================================
    FUNCTION: int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain);
    =================================================

    ==========================================================================
    ================================ EXAMPLES ================================
    ==========================================================================

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.


    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.


    *** Constraints ***
    n == gain.length
    1 <= n <= 100
    -100 <= gain[i] <= 100
