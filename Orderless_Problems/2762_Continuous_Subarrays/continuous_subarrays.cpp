    2762) Continuous Subarrays
    ===========================

    ============
    Description:
    ============

    You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A subarray of nums is called
   continuous if:

        + Let i, i + 1, ..., j be the indices in the subarray. Then, for each
          pair of indices i <= i1, i2 <= j, 0 <= |nums[i1] - nums[i2]| <= 2.

    Return the total number of continuous subarrays.

    A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

    ===========================================================
    FUNCTION: long long continuousSubarrays(vector<int>& nums);

    ==========================================================================
    ================================ EXAMPLES ================================
    ==========================================================================

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: nums = [5,4,2,4]
    Output: 8
    Explanation:
    Continuous subarray of size 1: [5], [4], [2], [4].
    Continuous subarray of size 2: [5,4], [4,2], [2,4].
    Continuous subarray of size 3: [4,2,4].
    Thereare no subarrys of size 4.
    Total continuous subarrays = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.
    It can be shown that there are no more continuous subarrays.

    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: nums = [1,2,3]
    Output: 6
    Explanation:
    Continuous subarray of size 1: [1], [2], [3].
    Continuous subarray of size 2: [1,2], [2,3].
    Continuous subarray of size 3: [1,2,3].
    Total continuous subarrays = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.


    *** Constraints ***
    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

    --- IDEA ---
    ------------

    This is a "Sliding Window" approach, but it has one VERY important "trick"
    that you must now, otherwise you wouldn't even try "Sliding Window". You
    wouldn't think basic "Sliding Window" can help us with this.

    Let's say that, somehow, you had all the continuous subarrays from [L, R-1]
    (Ignore difference of 2 between each pair for now)

                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        nums = [7,5,6,7,8,9,4,5,6,7]
                L       R

    Imagine that we had ALL the continuous non-empty subarrays from [L, R-1],
    inclusively. What would they be? And how much of them are there?

        size 1: {7}, {5}, {6}, {7}
        size 2: {7,5}, {5,6}, {6,7}
        size 3: {7,5,6}, {5,6,7}
        size 4: {7,5,6,7}

        So there are: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10

    But now consider this, this is the absolute CRUX of this "trick":

    If we now want to consider the element at index R as well, how many, would
    there be?

        size 1: {7}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}
        size 2: {7,5}, {5,6}, {6,7}, {7,8}
        size 3: {7,5,6}, {5,6,7}, {6,7,8}
        size 4: {7,5,6,7}, {5,6,7,8}
        size 5: {7,5,6,7,8}

        That's a total of: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15

    Hold on a second! Once R was less by one(i.e. 3), there where 10 subarrays,
    and now there are 15.

    So what is the difference? How many NEW ONES would we have if we extended
    previous window?
    We would have 5 more than before.

    Now consider this mindblowing fact:

        Earlier:
            L was 0
            R was 3

            and we had 10


        Now:
            L is 0
            R is 4

            and we have 15

        The difference is 5.


    Therefore if we wanted to add current element and then add ONLY subarrays
    that we have NOT counted in previous window(i.e. only subarrays that have
    this new element in it), ALL we have to do is this:

        R - L + 1

    That's the difference. That's how many new subarrays are there in total.
    This would work even if L is, for example, 3 and R is 9. It always works.

    This is VERY unintuitive to me and if you didn't see this before, it is
    almost impossible to come up with this Solution.

/*
    Time  Complexity: O(n)

    O(n * logk) ~ O(n)

    The outer loop iterates through the array once with the right pointer,
    taking O(n) operations. For each element, we perform map operations
    (insertion, deletion, finding min/max) which take O(logk) time, where k is
    the size of the map. Since we maintain a window where the max - min <= 2,
    the size of the sorted map k is bounded by 3 (as elements can only differ
    by 0, 1, or 2). Therefore, logk is effectively constant, making the overall
    time complexity O(n).

    (This is important to understand!)

*/
/*
    Space Complexity: O(n)

    The sorted map stores elements within the current window. Since the
    difference between any two elements in a valid window cannot exceed 2, the
    maximum number of unique elements (k) possible in the map at any time is 3.
    Therefore, the space complexity is constant, O(1)
