    ======================================
    1387) Sort Integers by The Power Value
    ======================================

    ============
    Description:
    ============

    The power of an integer x is defined as the number of steps needed to
    transform x into 1 using the following steps:

        if x is even then x = x / 2

        if x is odd then x = 3 * x + 1

    For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1
    (3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1).

    Given three integers lo, hi and k. The task is to sort all integers in the
    interval [lo, hi] by the power value in ascending order, if two or more
    integers have the same power value sort them by ascending order.

    Return the kth integer in the range [lo, hi] sorted by the power value.

    Notice that for any integer x (lo <= x <= hi) it is guaranteed that x will
    transform into 1 using these steps and that the power of x is will fit in a
    32-bit signed integer.

    ==========================================================================

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: lo = 12, hi = 15, k = 2
    Output: 13
    Explanation: The power of 12 is 9 (12 --> 6 --> 3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1)
    The power of 13 is 9
    The power of 14 is 17
    The power of 15 is 17
    The interval sorted by the power value [12,13,14,15]. For k = 2 answer is the second element which is 13.
    Notice that 12 and 13 have the same power value and we sorted them in ascending order. Same for 14 and 15.

    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: lo = 7, hi = 11, k = 4
    Output: 7
    Explanation: The power array corresponding to the interval [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] is [16, 3, 19, 6, 14].
    The interval sorted by power is [8, 10, 11, 7, 9].
    The fourth number in the sorted array is 7.

    Time Complexity (TC): O((hi - lo + 1) * log k + T)
    Space Complexity (SC): O(T + k),
    where T is the number of unique values computed in solve(x) and memoized.

    Minimum size of memo: 1000 Ã— 8 = 8000 is safe.
    Reason: The worst-case integer in [1, 1000] reaches at most ~8000 during
            the 3x+1 steps. So memo should at least handle numbers up to ~8000.
