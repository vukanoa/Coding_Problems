    2579) Count Total Number of Colored Cells
    =========================================

    ============
    Description:
    ============

    There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit
    cells. You are given a positive integer n, indicating that you must do the
    following routine for n minutes:

        + At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.

        + Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches
          a blue cell.

    Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes
    1, 2, and 3.

                                     O
                      O             OOO
        O     -->    OOO    -->    OOOOO
                      O             OOO
                                     O

       n=1           n=2            n=3

    Return the number of colored cells at the end of n minutes.

    ========================================
    FUNCTION: long long coloredCells(int n);
    ========================================

    ==========================================================================
    ================================ EXAMPLES ================================
    ==========================================================================

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 1
    Explanation: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.

    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 5
    Explanation: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary
    and 1 in the center, so we return 5.


    *** Constraints ***
    1 <= n <= 10^5

    n=1 and n=2 are unique cases, treat them separately.

    After that you can add additoinal:

        n=3)  3 * 2 + 2
        n=4)  5 * 2 + 2
        n=5)  7 * 2 + 2
        n=6)  9 * 2 + 2
        n=7) 11 * 2 + 2
        ...

    Why are we multiplying by 2 and why are we adding 2 afterwards?

    Consider this FOUNDATIONAL construction:

             O
            OOO
             O

    We can add, on TWO sides: one on top and two on the sides:

             X
            XOX
            OOO
            XOX
             X

    But we aren't done. We didn't add Xs on each side's "peak". That's why + 2.

             X
            XOX
           XOOOX
            XOX
             X

    And this is the n=3. From n=2 to n=3 we've added: 3 * 2 + 2.

    However, for n=4 we're going to add: 5 * 2 + 2.
    Look:

             _
            _X_
           _XOX_
          _XOOOX_
           _XOX_
            _X_
             _

    The pattern goes like this:

        n=3)  3 * 2 + 2
        n=4)  5 * 2 + 2
        n=5)  7 * 2 + 2
        n=6)  9 * 2 + 2
        n=7) 11 * 2 + 2
        ...

    Simple start at i=3 and go to our given Input n and add accordingly.
    Look at the code and it'll be clear.

    base is 3, because the difference between current i and base is our "step".

    Step is this
              |
              |
              v
        n=3)  3 * 2 + 2
        n=4)  5 * 2 + 2
        n=5)  7 * 2 + 2
        n=6)  9 * 2 + 2
        n=7) 11 * 2 + 2
        ...

    For example for n=7, step is:((7 - base) * 2)  * 2 + 2.

    But we can't just use this formula since we need all of the additions along
    the way. That's why we must iterate.

    How does anyone come up with this Solution?

    In the above Solution our "FOUNDATION" was 5, i.e. 1 + 4.

    After than, if you laid out the number you'd see the pattern:

        n=1) 1
        n=2) 1 + 4
        n=3) 1 + 4 + 8
        n=4) 1 + 4 + 12
        n=5) 1 + 4 + 16
        n=6) 1 + 4 + 20
        n=7) 1 + 4 + 24
        ...

    But let's see the pattern for FINAL results for these n values.

        n=1)    0   + 1           -->    0 +  1   -->    1
        n=2) F(n=1) + 1 + 4       -->    1 +  5   -->    6
        n=3) F(n=2) + 1 + 4 + 8   -->    6 + 13   -->   18
        n=4) F(n=3) + 1 + 4 + 12  -->   18 + 17   -->   35
        n=5) F(n=4) + 1 + 4 + 16  -->   35 + 21   -->   56
        n=6) F(n=5) + 1 + 4 + 20  -->   56 + 25   -->   81
        n=7) F(n=6) + 1 + 4 + 24  -->   81 + 29   -->   110
        ...

    Let's just write it next to n values:

        n=1)   1
        n=2)   6
        n=3)  18
        n=4)  35
        n=5)  56
        n=6)  81
        n=7)  110
        ..


    From our earlier observations, we know that we start with a single blue
    cell and then successively add multiples of 4:

    first 4 * 1, then 4 * 2, then 4 * 3, and so on, continuing for n - 1 steps.

    This means the total count follows the sum:

        1 + (4 * 1) + (4 * 2) + ... + (4 * (nâˆ’1))


    Or, we can write it like this:

        1 + 4 * ((n * (n-1)) / 2)

    Or if we cancel 4 and 2. we 'll have:

        1 + 2 * n * (n-1)


    However, since we need our result to be of type <long long>, we'll do this:

        return 1 + 2LL * n (n-1);

    2LL is a constant 2 written as a 64-bit integer, that way we won't have an
    overflow.
