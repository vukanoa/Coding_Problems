    3909) Compare Sums of Bitonic Parts
    ===================================

    ============
    Description:
    ============


    You are given a bitonic array nums of length n.

    Split the array into two parts:

        + Ascending part:  from index 0 to the peak element (inclusive).
        + Descending part: from the peak element to index n - 1 (inclusive).

    The peak element belongs to both parts.

    Return:

        + 0  if the sum of the ascending part is greater.
        + 1  if the sum of the descending part is greater.
        + -1 if both sums are equal.

    Notes:

        + A bitonic array is an array that is strictly increasing up to a
          single peak element and then strictly decreasing.

        + An array is said to be strictly increasing if each element is
          strictly greater than its previous one (if exists).

        + An array is said to be strictly decreasing if each element is
          strictly smaller than its previous one (if exists).

    ==========================================================================

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
        Peak element is nums[1] = 3
        Ascending part = [1, 3], sum is 1 + 3 = 4
        Descending part = [3, 2, 1], sum is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
        Since the descending part has a larger sum, return 1.

    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: nums = [2,4,5,2]
    Output: 0
    Explanation:
        Peak element is nums[2] = 5
        Ascending part = [2, 4, 5], sum is 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
        Descending part = [5, 2], sum is 5 + 2 = 7
        Since the ascending part has a larger sum, return 0.

    --- Example 3 ---
    Input: nums = [1,2,4,3]
    Output: -1
    Explanation:
        Peak element is nums[2] = 4
        Ascending part = [1, 2, 4], sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
        Descending part = [4, 3], sum is 4 + 3 = 7
        Since both parts have equal sums, return -1.


    *** Constraints ***
    3 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5
    1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
    nums is a bitonic array.
