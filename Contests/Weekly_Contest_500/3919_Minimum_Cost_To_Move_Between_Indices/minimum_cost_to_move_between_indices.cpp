    3919) Minimum Cost to Move Between Indices
    ==========================================

    ============
    Description:
    ============

    You are given an integer array nums where nums is strictly increasing.

    For each index x, let closest(x) be the adjacent index y such that
    abs(nums[x] - nums[y]) is minimized. If both adjacent indices exist and
    give the same difference, choose the smaller index.

    From any index x, you can move in two ways:

        + To any index y with cost abs(nums[x] - nums[y]), or
        + To closest(x) with cost 1.

    You are also given a 2D integer array queries, where each queries[i] = [li,
    ri].

    For each query, calculate the minimum total cost to move from index li to
    index ri.

    Return an integer array ans, where ans[i] is the answer for the ith query.

    The absolute difference between two values x and y is defined as abs(x - y).

    --- Example 1 ---
    Input: nums = [-5,-2,3], queries = [[0,2],[2,0],[1,2]]
    Output: [6,2,5]
    Explanation:
        The closest indices are [1, 0, 1] respectively.
        For [0, 2], the path 0 → 1 → 2 uses a closest move from index 0 to 1 with cost 1 and a move from index 1 to 2 with cost |-2 - 3| = 5, giving total 1 + 5 = 6.
        For [2, 0], the path 2 → 1 → 0 uses two closest moves from index 2 to 1 and from index 1 to 0, each with cost 1, giving total 2.
        For [1, 2], the direct move from index 1 to index 2 has cost |-2 - 3| = 5, which is optimal.
    Thus, ans = [6, 2, 5].


    --- Example 2 ---
    Input: nums = [0,2,3,9], queries = [[3,0],[1,2],[2,0]]
    Output: [4,1,3]
    Explanation:
        The closest indices are [1, 2, 1, 2] respectively.
        For [3, 0], the path 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 uses closest moves from index 3 to 2 and from 2 to 1, each with cost 1, and a move from 1 to 0 with cost |2 - 0| = 2, giving total 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
        For [1, 2], the closest move from index 1 to 2 has cost 1.
        For [2, 0], the path 2 → 1 → 0 uses a closest move from index 2 to 1 with cost 1 and a move from 1 to 0 with cost |2 - 0| = 2, giving total 1 + 2 = 3.
    Thus, ans = [4, 1, 3].


    *** Constraints ***

    queries[i] = [li, ri]
